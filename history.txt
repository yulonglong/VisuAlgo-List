remove all works,

insert to tail works.

but there is a bug with inserting to tail after removing any non-tail nodes. 

bug fixed by using a new variabe vertexClassNumberCounter, which starts from 9 and ++ all the way.

implemented insert kth, except insert to index 0 (insert to head)
insert to head still not functional

remove head contains bug for special case when the size of the linked list is 1.

remove kth works just fine though
